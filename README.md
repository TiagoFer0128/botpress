Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in Javascript. It is powered by a rich set of open-source modules built by the community. We like to say that **Botpress is like the Wordpress of Chatbots**; anyone can create and reuse other people's modules.

## What is Botpress

Botpress is on a mission to make useful bots ubiquitous by powering developers with the best possible tools to build & manage chatbots. We believe that in order to create great bots, major time should be spent on UX, **not** on the surrounding (and generic) features.

## Getting Started Quickly

The best way to get started quickly is to read our [Getting Started Tutorial](https://botpress.io/docs/10.0/getting_started/).

## Installation

Botpress requires [node](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 6.10) and uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as package manager.

```
npm install -g botpress@beta
```

## Creating a bot

Creating a bot is simple, you need to run [`botpress init`](https://botpress.io/docs/reference/cli.html#init) in a terminal inside an empty directory:

```
botpress init my-bot
```

Once your bot is created, you need to run [`botpress start`](https://botpress.io/docs/reference/cli.html#start) to start your bot:

```
botpress start
```

This will provide you locally a web interface available at **`http://localhost:3000`**
