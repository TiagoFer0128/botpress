Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in Javascript. It is powered by a rich set of modules built by the community. Botpress is on a mission to make bots ubiquitous and profitable for everybody.

## Installation

Botpress requires [node](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 4.2) and uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as package manager.

```
npm install -g botpress
```

## Usage

Creating a bot is simple, simple run [`botpress init`](TODO) inside an empty directory:

```
mkdir my-bot && cd my-bot
botpress init
```

Once your bot created, you may [start](TODO) your bot:

```
botpress start
```

This will provide you with a web interface available at `http://localhost:3000`

You then need to install some [modules](TODO). You can do so directly in the web interface or using the [`botpress install`](TODO) CLI command:

```
botpress install messenger
```

For a more detailed usage guide, please read the [Getting Started Guide](TODO).

## Examples

There's a [video in YouTube](TODO) that shows how to create a Hello World messenger bot in under 45 seconds.

- [Todolist Messenger Bot](TODO)
- [Scheduling Messages](TODO)
- [Bot Analytics](TODO)

Many more code examples are available in the **[Examples repository](TODO)**
