Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in TypeScript. It is powered by a rich set of open-source modules built by the community. We like to say that **Botpress is like the WordPress of bots**; anyone can create and reuse other people's modules.

## What's New in Botpress Server

Botpress is on a mission to make useful bots ubiquitous by powering developers with the best possible tools to build & manage chatbots. We believe that in order to create great bots, significant time should be spent on user experience, **not** on the surrounding (and generic) features.

## Binaries

You can download the binaries [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botpress-binaries/index.html).

## Quick Start

1. Run `yarn` to fetch node packages.
1. Run `yarn bootstrap` to build the admin website and buid the app.
1. Run `yarn start` to start the server.

### Building issues

If you have errors when building modules (timeout, random errors, etc), try the following:

1. Set the environment variable GULP_SERIES=true before starting the build
1. If it doesn't work, go in each module folder and type `yarn && yarn build`

## Target a specific Botpress Edition

You can target a specific Botpress Edition when building the app. Just add the following environment variable: `EDITION=<ce|pro|ee> yarn build`. This will fetch the pro submodule and build the app. By default, `yarn build` will target the Community Edition.

## Documentation

### Developer's Guide

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/en/) to create the Developer's Guide.

- To start the development server, run `yarn start:guide`
- To generate the static files, run `yarn build:guide`. The generated files will appear under `/docs/guide/build`

### SDK Reference

We use [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) the generate the SDK Reference directly from the source code.

- Run `yarn build:reference` to generate the documentation. THe static files will appear under `/docs/reference/`.
