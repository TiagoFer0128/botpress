  <body>
    This is an example of embedded webchat, which replaces the composer with a component exported from another module
  </body>

  <script>
    window.botpressWebChat.init({
      host: 'http://localhost:3000',
      botId: 'welcome-bot',
      overrides: {
        // For now, the composer is the only component which is editable. It represents the zone where the user is typing
        composer: {
          //Name of the module, as declared in package.json
          module: 'custom-component',
          // Make sure that the name here matches the one in package.json -> liteViews
          view: 'components',
          // The name of your exported component. If you used export default, use default here.
          component: 'Composer'
        }
      }
    })
