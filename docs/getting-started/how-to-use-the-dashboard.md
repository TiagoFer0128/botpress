# How to use the Dashboard

Botpress ships a beautiful dashboard acessible by default on `localhost:3000`.

You can do a lot of things there:

* Manage Middleware Flow
* Install and uninstall modules
* See botpress logs in real-time
* Change modules configurations
* Get real-time notifications about your bot
* and more

Let's learn a little about each functionality.

## Manage Middleware Flow

At homepage, you'll see two widgets: _Incoming Middleware_ and _Outgoing Middleware_.

It's here to show the middleware processing order. You can change it all the time.

## Install and Uninstall modules

You can manage your all modules using the *Modules* menu on sidebar. It provide a list of all available modules, with description, creator and star number on Githhub.

## See botpress logs in real time

You can see logs clicking on the icon at toolbar. It will show recents logs and the option to export archive log.

## Change modules configuration

The majority of the modules provide an UI to manage configurations. When you install a new module, is created a new menu item on sidebar and you can access it.
