Overview

### What is a bot?

A bot is simply a software that its primary user interface is a Conversational User Interface (CUI). These interfaces include:
- Chat (Messenger, Skype, Slack)
- Telephone (IVRs, SMS)
- Mobile and IoT (Alexa, Google Home, Siri)

Bots are not new, they have been around for decades already and almost every business already use them in some way (especially IVRs). 

With the recent rise of IoT and Messaging, bot are a very hot topic and technology around them has evolved dramatically in the last few years, which allows us to build better bots.

### What is Botpress?

Botpress is an open-source bot building platform. It's in a way extremely similar to Wordpress for websites, so we like to say that it's the Wordpress of Bots. 

Thousands of developers around the world have built bots on Botpress and we're proud to be playing such a major role in the shaping of the upcoming global conversational revolution.

### Why use Botpress?

Unlike SaaS bot building platforms (which are too simplistic, limited and risky for most business usage), Botpress is an open, fast, flexible and extensible platform built and maintained professionally by Botpress Inc and hundreds of open-source contributors world-wide.

And unlike some other open-source bot frameworks, Botpress is not a only framework, it is a complete platform. What we mean by complete platform is that you have all the tools that you would find in a complete SaaS product, not just a simplistic state management framework.

That means that the developers have the joy and freedom of having a nice framework with solid foundations while non-technical people will enjoy having all the tools they expect to manage the bot once deployed. As a developer, you simply build on top of Botpress to offer the non-technical people the best management portal for their use cases.

Here are just a few of the many things Botpress ships with:
- A sophisticated Dialog Manager and Visual Flow Builder
- A Content Manager for non-technical
- A powerful Natural Language Understanding toolkit
- A built-in database
- Marketing tools for non-technical
- Powerful analytics with custom metrics

### How long will it take to Get Started?

After about 5 minutes, you should have a bot fully working on your local machine and deploying to the cloud takes an other 5 minutes.

The normal and easiest way to get started is to clone an existing Bot Template and customize it.
