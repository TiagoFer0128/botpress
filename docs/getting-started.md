## Installation

To install botpress, you need [NPM](https://npmjs.com) version 4.2 or higher.

```
npm install -g botpress
```

**For developers**: Botpress needs to be installed globally on developers machine in order to create a bot and install modules. 

**To run a bot**: botpress does not need to be installed, as botpress is installed as a local dependency in the bot.

## Command line tool

The global command line tool is available as `botpress` and `bp`. For example, running `bp init` is the equivalent of running `botpress init`.

**[!] Ruby users**: If you have Ruby installed, `bp` might already be linked to the `Bundle Package Command`, in which case you must either use `botpress` or change your `bp` symbolic link to point to botpress instead.
