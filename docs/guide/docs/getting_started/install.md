Getting started with Botpress is very easy. You may download the source code and build it yourself, but we also provide and recommend using the binaries.

## As a self-contained binary <a class="toc" id="binary" href="#binary"></a>

This is the easiest way to kick start your development. The server comes already compiled and is bundled with NodeJS 10, nothing else is required.

[Download one of our binary](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botpress-binaries) (available for MAC, Linux and Windows), extract the files and launch the main executable (bp)

## Use our Docker image

The docker images simply loads the linux binary and sets up persistent storage. You may then easily create your Dockerfile based from this image and deploy it in the cloud.

## Build from source <a class="toc" id="source" href="#source"></a>

Clone the main git repository and follow the instructions in the readme.

Botpress runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 8.2). You must also have either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed.
