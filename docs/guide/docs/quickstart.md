## CLI

You can run Botpress by using the _Command Line Interface_ (CLI), which we recommend doing when developing your bots since you can use the CLI to enable the critical debugging messages.

> **Tip**: To start your bot in development mode, use `./bp --verbose` or simply `./bp -v`.

To see all the commands available, run `./bp --help`.

##### Example

```
> ./bp --help
Options:
  --version         Show version number                                [boolean]
  --verbose, -v     verbosity level                         [count] [default: 0]
  --production, -p  run in production mode            [boolean] [default: false]
  --help            Show help                                          [boolean]
```
