Webchat carousel is a useful way of showing a collection of elements. The example below shows two different types of element, shown in a responsive layout, depending on the width of the users device.

The webchat supports the following action buttons out of the box:

- Say something: When clicked, the text of the button is sent to the bot
- Open URL: When clicked, the url is opened in a new window

You can check the [package README](https://github.com/botpress/botpress/tree/master/modules/channel-web) for all the options you can pass into the carousel object.
