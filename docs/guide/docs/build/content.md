[TODO] Explain how all the content the bot says is actually centralized in the CMS

# CMS

Botpress includes its own CMS to manage all the content that a bot says so that everything is centralized.

## Content Type

We use what we call _Content Types_ to define the structure of what the bot sends. It also tells how the content should be rendered. For instance, a content type could be a simple text or an image or a carousel. It can be as simple or as complex as you want. A restaurant could create a "menu" content type to respond to a user that asks for the menu. Another example could be a "contact" content type that display the restaurant's location on Google Maps and their contact information.

### Render Function

## Content Element

_Content Elements_

> **Tip**: Remember that a Content Type tells **how** content gets rendered and a Content Element tells **what** to render.

## Best Practices

[TODO] Explain how to change how the messages are rendered by modifying the Renderers
[TODO] Explain that it's possible to create a new Content Type to represent a primitive concept of the bot and how it's rendered on the different chat platforms
