Botpress comes in 2 different flavors: Community and Professionnal!!!

## Community

This edition is completely open-source. You are able to create an unlimited amount of bots. However, there is only one user, and it is not possible to create teams or manage different roles.

## Professional

Depending on your license, you may add a certain number of users which can access the administration panel.
