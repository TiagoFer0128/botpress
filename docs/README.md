# Introduction

## What is Botpress

Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in Javascript. It is powered by a rich set of open-source modules built by the community. We like to say that **Botpress is like the Wordpress of Chatbots**; anyone can create and reuse other people's modules.

## Why you should use Botpress

For the same reason why millions of people use Wordpress to create a website, people use Botpress to create bots. Botpress handles everything generic about bots so that you can really focus on building conversational masterpieces and deliver real value to your customers. You don't have to write everything from scratch; most (if not everything) has already been implemented in Botpress Core or by community modules. Just write your logic.

## The mission

Botpress simply professionalizes chatbot development. We believe that the bot ecosystem needs a leading, world-class, professional and fast-evolving tool for developers. We're commited to build and invent the tools that will pioneer the conversational revolution.

## What's the difference between Botpress and the other frameworks?

We have used professionally the other bot making frameworks and we faced many frustrations. We don't want to critize anybody's hard work, but we don't believe the other tools are anywhere close to what developers need to create truly great and useful bots.

There are many things Botpress does differently, but probably the biggest difference is the highly modular ecosystem. There's a module for about everything your bot should do, so you can focus on what truly matters.
