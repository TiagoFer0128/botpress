Flow:
  - Keep track of pending changes

    - Redo to restore
  - Save changes (submit changes to the server)
    - WARN: We need to keep track of nodes by Id and not by name since name can change
    - Submit the nodes + values + metadata [x,y]
    - Submit the links + values + metadata [points]
  - Create a new flow (unsaved)
    - Prompt if unsaved changes before change flow
    - Default name (unnamed flow)
  - Keep unsaved changes in local storage

  - (See all flows, last modified date, # of nodes, who modified it)
    - Search/Filter of the flows
    - Load flow on Enter
      - Prompt if unsaved changes before change flow

Workspace:
  - Save workspace disposition to local storage
  - Reset workspace disposition
